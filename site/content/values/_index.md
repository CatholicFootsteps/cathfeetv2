      Our mission is to rekindle an excitement and appreciation of Catholic
      heritage and legacy by bringing students to the sites of great historical
      and religious significance.  Like the parable of Jesus leading his disciples
      across a wide river and trusting that God, the Father, would deliver them
      safely to the other shore,  our motto is- 
      When we have faith and trust in God, we can achieve anything,
      even if it seems impossible.

       Understanding Catholic history and heritage are important to learn
       because it helps students understand how the Catholic Church has played
       a significant role in shaping the world we live in today. It helps them
       understand the beliefs and traditions of the Catholic Church and how 
       they have evolved over time. Students can gain a deeper understanding
       of their own faith and how it connects to the world around them. 
       Learning about their Catholic heritage also helps students appreciate
       and respect the diversity of beliefs and cultures within our society.

  - heading: "Social Justice and Equity"
    text: >
      Social justice and equity are important in Catholicism because they
      align with the teachings of Jesus and the Catholic Church to love 
      and care for all people, especially those who are marginalized or oppressed. 
      Social justice refers to the fair distribution of resources and 
      opportunities for all people, while equity ensures that everyone has what 
      they need to thrive. 
      For this reason, all aspects of our programming, from obtaining passports and 
      luggage, to having funds for keepsakes, are all-inclusive and free to student 
      participants and their accompanying parent or guardian.

  - heading: "Diversity- They, Us, We"
    text: >
      The Catholic Church teaches that all people are created in the image of God 
      and should be treated with dignity and respect. Therefore, Catholics are 
      called to work towards creating a just society where everyone has equal 
      opportunities and is treated with fairness and compassion. This includes 
      working towards ending poverty, promoting education, and fighting for the 
      rights of marginalized groups. We value diversity.  We value you!

  - heading: "Investing in the Global Catholic Community"
    text: >
      The Catholic Church is a global community, rather than simply as a
      collection of national or regional churches. Catholic Footsteps emphasizes
      the importance of connecting and collaborating with Catholics from all over the world, and working
      together to address global issues. 
      Catholic Footsteps encourages Catholics to be more aware of the diverse cultures and
      traditions within the Church, and to celebrate and learn from the richness of these
      differences.
